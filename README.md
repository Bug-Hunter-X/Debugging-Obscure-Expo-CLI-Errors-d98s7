# Debugging Obscure Expo CLI Errors in React Native with Expo

This repository demonstrates common scenarios leading to cryptic errors when using the Expo CLI with React Native. These errors often lack detailed explanations, making debugging difficult.

## Common Causes

* **Dependency Conflicts:** Mismatched versions of libraries, especially those with native modules, can cause build failures.
* **Native Module Issues:** Problems in the native code (Android/iOS) used by third-party libraries or custom modules often produce unclear error messages in the Expo CLI.
* **Incorrect Project Setup:** Inconsistent configurations (e.g., incorrect package.json, app.json, or native project settings) can lead to subtle yet impactful errors.
* **Ejection Complications:** If you've ejected from Expo's managed workflow, ensuring proper configuration of the native Android and iOS projects is crucial.  Failure to do so leads to build errors that are hard to interpret.
