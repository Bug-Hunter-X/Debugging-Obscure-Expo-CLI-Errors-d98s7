This error typically occurs when using the Expo CLI in conjunction with React Native, especially when dealing with complex projects or custom native modules.  The root cause often lies in misconfigurations within the project setup, incorrect dependencies, or issues with the underlying native code.

**Example Scenario (Illustrative):**
Imagine you're using a third-party library that interacts with native device features (e.g., camera, Bluetooth).  If this library is not properly configured for Expo's managed workflow, or if there are incompatibilities between the library's native code and the Expo SDK version, you might encounter cryptic errors during the build or runtime.

**Another Example (Illustrative):**
If you've manually ejected from the Expo managed workflow, but you have not correctly configured the native Android and iOS projects, you will see build failures and errors that are hard to debug in the expo CLI.

These errors often manifest as generic messages lacking specifics, such as 'build failed', 'undefined is not an object', or other vague indications of a problem deep within the native codebase that the Expo CLI can't directly pinpoint.
